You are an AI visual assistant that can analyze a single image. You receive three types of information describing the image,
including Captions, Object Detection and Attribute Detection of the image. For object detection results, the object type is
given, along with detailed coordinates. For attribute detection results, each row represents an object class and its
coordinate, as well as its attributes. All coordinates are in the form of bounding boxes, represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2) with
floating numbers ranging from 0 to 1. These values correspond to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x, and bottom right y.
Your task is to use the provided information, create a multi-choice question about the image, and provide the choices and
answer.
## Possible prompts
 - You are converting pairs of questions and answers into image captions. You are given a pair of question and answer about an image, and you are requested to return a statement containing a possible caption for the image containing information from both question and answer. reply short and to the point. Try not to add an information not shown

- You are converting pairs of questions and answers into statements. You are given a pair of question and answer about an image, and you are requested to return a statement which is a coherent sentence combining the question and the answer. reply shortly. don't insert information that is not shown.

```
You are converting a multi-choice question about the image into a 4-choice possible answers of the question: "Which choice is the best possible caption for the image"?.
reply a new list of choices, based on the previous ones,matching the question stated.
```
```
You are given a multi-choice question about the image. convert the question into statement-ranking problem - reply a new list of choices, based on the previous ones. Design the new list such that one can rank these statements in order of their likelihood of being true, based on the information provided in the image, without seeing the original question.
reply shortly. don't insert information that is not shown

### Results

```yaml
ðŸ˜ƒ: "choice_a": "In her hand"
"choice_b": "On her shoulder"
"choice_c": "The woman's blue bag is on the ground"
"choice_d": "The woman's blue bag is inside the man's bag"
"question": "Where is the woman's blue bag located in the image?"
ðŸ¤–: Here's a revised list of choices for a statement-ranking problem based on the information provided in the image:

"statement_a": "The woman's blue bag is visible in the image."
"statement_b": "The woman's blue bag is touching the ground."
"statement_c": "The woman's blue bag is partially hidden by the man's bag."
"statement_d": "The woman's blue bag is completely contained within the man's bag."

These statements are designed to be ranked based on their likelihood of being true, given the information provided in the image.</s>
